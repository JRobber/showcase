# Project Summary

In this project we will take a look at a react application created using `create-react-app`. The layout has already been created for us but none of the functionality works. At the end of this project you should have an understanding of the following topics:

* Components
* State
* Props
* Import / Export
* .gitignore
* NPM install

After completing this project you'll have the knowledge to add more toy problems as you complete them throughout your time at DevMountain. You can also expand from toy problems if you like by adding tricks you learn during DevMountain.
