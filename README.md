# Project Summary

In this project we will create a react application from scratch using `create-react-app`. This project will be an appendix of computer science toy problems. We will have a navigation bar on the left of toy problem topics that will then change the workspace view on the right. At the end of this project you should have a comfortable understanding on how to quickly boot up a React project using `create-react-app` and have a comfortable understanding of the following topics:

* Components
* State
* Props
* Import / Export
* .gitignore
* NPM install

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step we will quickly create a boilerplate for our React project by using `create-react-app`. After `create-react-app` has finished we will start our development server that `create-react-app` provides.

### Detailed Instructions

When in the root of the project use `creare-react-app app`. After `create-react-app` has finished `cd` into `app` and run `npm start`.

### Solution

You should now have a file structure like this:

```
- app
  - node_modules
  - public
  - src
  - .gitignore
  - packge.json
  - README.md
  - yarn.lock
- README.md 
```

And a browser pop up that looks like this:
